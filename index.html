<h1>Index Of Demo Test Pages For Google Web Fonts</h1>

<a href="drag'n'dropfont-Latin4.htm" target="_blank">Drag 'n' Drop Font X-Ray for Adobe Latin 4</a><br />
<p>To load a font to test, just drag and drop any TTF, OTF, or WOFF file onto the Font Loader Bar. (In the download zip package, there are two ttf files named randomfont1.ttf and randomfont2.ttf you can use for testing drag 'n'drop. Be aware that you can load more than one font file and they will remain listed in the Font Loader Bar and individually selectable until the page is refreshed. Note also that the Font Loader Bar can be gotten out of the way and hidden from view just by clicking the "Drag Bar Off" button in the upper left of the page. If you need the loader bar back again to load or select another font just click the "Drag Bar On" button.<p>
<a href="drag'n'dropfont-PANGRAMS-EN-Thai.htm" target="_blank">Drag 'n' Drop Pangrams for English and Thai</a><br />
<p>This page also uses a drag and drop Font Loader Bar but instead of checking a font's support for a character set, this page has two categories of test phrases -  two for the Thai language and several others for English. Notice that since the default font when the page first loads is Arial, there aren't any Thai characters to display. And that's why you see the "backdrop" fallback font which shows the Unicode points for those characters instead of glyphs. As is the case in all these test pages, the backdrop font which contains a huge set of Unicode characters is embedded in the page using a Base 64 Data URI made from a WOFF of the original TTF font. This page was a bit of a quick experiment to show how different kinds of phrases and languages can be mixed together to either check each individually or to see how they flow and/or contrast in the same sentence or paragraph.</p>
<a href="Latin-4-Test_1-plusThai.htm" target="_blank">Google Web Font X-Ray Test Page for Thai and the Adobe Latin 4 Character Set</a><br />
<p>This is not a drag and drop page. It uses a @font-face declaration of your choice and loads that particular font to see if it covers or doesn't cover, the characters in the Thai language (as defined in the Unicode standard) and also the Adobe Latin 4 set.<br />
The font chosen here is Athiti Regular (400) which is a recent project by foundry Cadson Demak for Google Fonts.<br />There are at least two potential problems revealed by this test: 1) There is no SCHWA character, which technically IS called for in the Adobe Latin 4 set and 2) The combined Capital G with Tilde in the next to last table cel in the Latin 4 table, isn't displaying correctly. The tilde is lying on top (or on bottom) of the Capital G. As of this writing, I haven't checked for the cause of the malfunction.</p>
<a href="Latin-1-Test_1.htm" target="_blank">Google Web Font X-Ray Test Page for the Adobe Latin 1 Character Set</a><br />
<p>Checks for the Latin 1 set. </p>
<a href="Latin-2-Test_1.htm" target="_blank">Google Web Font X-Ray Test Page for the Adobe Latin 2 Character Set</a><br />
<p><p>Checks for the Latin 2 set.</p></p>
<a href="Latin-3-Test_1.htm" target="_blank">Google Web Font X-Ray Test Page for the Adobe Latin 3 Character Set</a><br />
<p>Checks for the Latin 3 set.</p>
<a href="Latin-4-Test_1.htm" target="_blank">Google Web Font X-Ray Test Page for the Adobe Latin 4 Character Set</a><br />
<p>Checks for the Latin 4 set.</p>
<p>Note: there will soon be a test page with which the user, with a click, can select any of the Adobe sets to check the font (including Latin 5) using the same page.</p>
<h2>Notes On Technical Aims For These Google Font Test Pages</h2>
These pages are Beta pages but the development is pretty far along and polished, Version 1.0, pages will be posted in my Github repository very soon. (<a href="https://github.com/richardfink/webfont-testpages">Google Web Font Test Pages On Github - Richard Fink</a> Please note that while the test pages listed here could be linked together to form a comprehensive suite of pages - one requirement is that each page - unlinked to any other page - is totally usable as a standalone HTML page by itself, without dependencies on any external .js or .css or img src files. All necessary JavaScript and Style Sheets are contained within each .htm file. The only outside files needed will be the TTFs, OTFs, WOFFS, or EOTS, for the test pages that don't rely on Drag 'n' Drop and instead rely on a web font file with a particular name and location to load and test. This independence pays off in simplicity - you can pick just the one test page you want and begin using it without any thought about other files that need to travel along with it. Also - these test pages all use "file:///" URLS and can therefore run on your local hard drive and <b>don't require an http server to deliver the pages.</b> Once again, keeping the test pages simple and easy to insert into your work flow, is a top priority.</p>
